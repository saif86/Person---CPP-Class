# Person---CPP-Class
Defining class in C++

## Problem Statement
Create a **Person** class that includes fields for *last name*, *first name*, and *zip code*. Include a default constructor that initializes *last name*, *first name*, and *zip code* to *"X"* if no arguments are supplied. Also include a display function. Write a main( ) function that instantiates and displays two **Person** objects: one that uses the default values, and one for which you supply your own values. Save the file as *Person.cpp*.
